Integrity checker — detects mismatches, orphans, and data quality issues.

Run after each sync operation to detect NEW issues.
Only creates audit_issues for problems not already tracked.

Issue Types:
- note_mismatch: Guild note changed and no longer matches linked player (logged by db_sync)
- orphan_wow: Character in guild but no player link
- orphan_discord: Discord member with guild role but no player link
- role_mismatch: In-game rank doesn't match Discord role
- stale_character: Character hasn't logged in for >30 days
- no_guild_role: Discord member linked to a player but has no guild Discord role
